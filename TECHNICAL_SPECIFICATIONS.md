# Murmuration - Technical Specifications

## Project Overview
Murmuration is an interactive application that simulates the flocking behavior of starlings, known as murmurations. The application will render a visually appealing simulation of birds in flight, following established flocking algorithms, with user-controllable parameters. A unique feature will be the ability to transition the flock into forming text or symbols on command.

## Core Features

### 1. Murmuration Simulation
- Real-time visualization of flocking birds
- Physics-based movement with natural-looking behaviors
- Smooth transitions and fluid motion
- Realistic bird appearance and animation

### 2. Parameterized Controls
- Number of birds (10-10,000)
- Flight speed
- Cohesion factor (how strongly birds are attracted to each other)
- Alignment factor (how strongly birds align their direction with neighbors)
- Separation factor (how strongly birds avoid collisions)
- Perception radius (how far each bird can "see" other birds)
- Environmental factors (wind, obstacles)
- Visual settings (bird size, color schemes, trail effects)

### 3. Text/Symbol Formation Mode
- Ability to input custom text or select predefined symbols
- Smooth transition from natural murmuration to formation
- Adjustable formation density and clarity
- Option to maintain formation or dissolve back into natural murmuration
- Support for basic font styles and simple vector graphics

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- Canvas-based rendering (HTML5 Canvas or WebGL)
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Intuitive user interface for parameter adjustments
- Real-time performance optimization

### Simulation Engine
- Boids algorithm implementation (Reynolds rules)
- Vector-based physics calculations
- Spatial partitioning for performance optimization
- Text/symbol path generation algorithm

### Data Model
- Bird entities with properties:
  - Position (x, y, z)
  - Velocity vector
  - Acceleration vector
  - Rotation
  - Size
  - State (free-flying vs. formation)
- Global simulation state
- User preferences and settings

## Performance Considerations
- Efficient rendering techniques (instanced rendering, LOD)
- Worker threads for computation when available
- Spatial partitioning to optimize neighbor calculations
- Adaptive quality settings based on device capability
- Frame rate targeting and throttling

## User Experience
- Simple, intuitive controls
- Real-time parameter adjustment with immediate visual feedback
- Presets for different murmuration styles
- Ability to save and share configurations
- Optional tutorial or help system

## Accessibility
- Keyboard controls for all interactive elements
- Color schemes considerate of color vision deficiencies
- Alternative text descriptions for visual elements
- Pause and speed control options

## Future Expansion Possibilities
- 3D rendering mode
- VR/AR compatibility
- Multi-user shared experiences
- AI-driven murmurations
- Integration with music/audio input
- Physical installation mode for galleries or public spaces

## Technical Requirements
- Modern web browser with WebGL support
- Minimum 4GB RAM recommended for larger simulations
- Processing power equivalent to at least an Intel i5 or equivalent
- Stable internet connection for any cloud-based features
