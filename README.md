## Overview

Murmuration is an interactive web application that simulates the mesmerizing flocking behavior of starlings in flight. The application offers a customizable, visually stunning representation of bird flocks, with physically accurate movement patterns based on the Boids algorithm.

### Key Features

- **Real-time Simulation**: Experience the beauty of starling murmurations with realistic flocking behaviors
- **Customizable Parameters**: Control flock size, speed, cohesion, alignment, and separation
- **Text & Symbol Formation**: Watch as birds transition from natural flocking to form text or symbols
- **High Performance**: Optimized rendering for smooth animation even with thousands of birds
- **Beautiful Visuals**: Stunning visual effects with customizable appearance
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Responsive design works across devices

## Getting Started

### For Users

#### Access the Live Application
Visit [https://jhalaga.github.io/murmuration/](https://jhalaga.github.io/murmuration/) to interact with the application directly in your browser.

#### Usage Instructions
1. Use the control panel to adjust flocking parameters
2. Experiment with different text or symbol formations
3. Try different visual styles and colors
4. The simulation runs best on modern browsers and desktop devices

2. Commit and push to GitHub
3. Run `npm run deploy`
4. The application will be accessible at https://jhalaga.github.io/murmuration/

## How It Works

Murmuration uses the Boids algorithm (by Craig Reynolds) to simulate flocking behavior based on three simple rules:

1. **Separation**: Birds avoid crowding their neighbors
2. **Alignment**: Birds steer towards the average heading of their neighbors
3. **Cohesion**: Birds move toward the average position of their neighbors

For the text/symbol formation feature, we implement a force-based targeting system that gradually guides birds to form shapes while maintaining natural-looking movement.
